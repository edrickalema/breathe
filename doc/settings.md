OverviewThe Settings screen is the control center where users configure all aspects of Breathe's behavior. It provides granular control over companion personality, doomscroll detection sensitivity, focus session defaults, app monitoring, blocking preferences, and general app behavior. The design philosophy is transparency and empowerment—users should understand exactly what each setting does and have full control over their experience.Screen Layout & OrganizationVisual StructureThe settings screen uses a scrollable vertical layout with sections grouped into collapsible cards. Each section has a clear header, descriptive subtext explaining what controls affect, and related settings grouped together. Use generous spacing between sections for visual breathing room and clear hierarchy.The screen opens with user profile section at top showing companion in current mood state, username or greeting text, and quick access to account actions. Below that, settings sections are ordered from most frequently accessed to least: Companion & Mood, App Management, Focus Sessions, Doomscroll Detection, Notifications & Alerts, General Preferences, Data & Privacy, About & Support.Navigation PatternSettings lives as a separate screen accessible from tab bar overflow menu or dedicated settings icon. Users navigate to settings, make changes which apply immediately (no save button needed—changes persist automatically), and return to previous screen via back button. Critical changes that require app restart show toast notification explaining this.Companion & Mood SectionCompanion Personality SettingsCustomize Companion Name
Allow users to name their companion character. Default is "Companion" but personalization increases emotional attachment. Text input field with character limit of 15. Name appears throughout app in messages and notifications. Examples: "Buddy", "Luna", "Focus Friend".Mood Sensitivity
Control how reactive the companion is to behavior changes. Slider with three labeled positions: Chill (companion mood changes slowly, takes sustained patterns to shift), Balanced (default, responds to daily patterns), Responsive (companion mood shifts quickly based on recent behavior).Explanation text: "This controls how quickly your companion's mood reflects your digital habits. More sensitive means faster feedback on your actions."Encouraging vs Honest Tone
Toggle between communication styles. Encouraging mode uses supportive, positive language even when patterns concerning—"I notice you've been on your phone a lot. Want to try a focus session together?". Honest mode gives direct feedback without sugar-coating—"You've been doomscrolling for 25 minutes. This isn't serving you."Users who respond better to gentle nudges choose encouraging. Those who want blunt accountability choose honest. Default to encouraging for broader appeal.Faith-Based Mode Toggle
Optional religious/spiritual overlay. When enabled, reflection prompts include scriptural references, daily verses appear on home screen, intervention messages reference biblical themes of rest and stewardship, weekly insights include faith perspective on time management.Clear explanation that this is optional enhancement for users who find spiritual encouragement meaningful. Disabled by default. Respects all faith traditions in implementation—language should be inclusive not denominational.App Management SectionThis is the core section for controlling which apps Breathe monitors and blocks. It's the most complex settings area requiring careful UX design.Apps to MonitorMaster List of Installed Apps
Display scrollable list of all non-system apps installed on device. Each app shows its icon, name, and toggle switch. When toggled on, Breathe monitors that app for doomscrolling detection and includes it in usage statistics.Smart defaults: pre-enable common social media and entertainment apps (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Snapchat) since these are primary doomscrolling culprits. Pre-disable productivity apps (email, calendar, notes, work apps) and utility apps (camera, maps, settings).Search bar at top allows filtering long app lists. Categories or filters for quick selection: Social Media, Entertainment, News, Games, Shopping. Bulk actions: "Select All Social Media Apps", "Disable All Monitoring".Explanation text at top: "Choose which apps Breathe monitors for doomscrolling patterns and includes in your statistics. Monitoring doesn't block apps—it just tracks usage to help you build awareness."App Blocking PreferencesDefault Focus Blocked Apps
Separate list showing which apps automatically block when starting focus sessions. Similar UI to monitoring list—app icons with toggles. These defaults can be overridden per session, but this sets the starting point.Smart defaults: enable same social media and entertainment apps. Allow users to add work-related distractors like Slack, Email if those become procrastination tools.Quick presets: "Block All Social Media", "Block Entertainment Only", "Deep Work Mode (blocks everything except productivity apps)", "Custom Selection".Block Enforcement Style
Choice between enforcement levels when apps are blocked during focus sessions:
Friendly Reminder: Show overlay with companion when attempting to open blocked app. User can dismiss after reading message. Logs attempt but doesn't prevent access. Least restrictive.

Timed Delay: Show intervention overlay requiring 10-second wait before access granted. Breathing exercise during delay. Creates friction without hard blocking. Default option balancing effectiveness and autonomy.

Hard Block: Cannot access app at all during focus session. Requires ending session early to gain access. Overlay shows time remaining in session and encouragement to stay focused. Most restrictive.
Explanation: "How strictly should Breathe enforce app blocks during focus sessions? Friendly reminders give you choice, timed delays create intentional friction, hard blocks prevent access entirely."App-Specific RulesPer-App Custom Settings
Tap any app in monitoring list to access detailed configuration:Daily Time Limit: Set maximum minutes allowed per day for this specific app. When limit reached, app auto-blocks until next day. Slider from 0 (complete block) to 240 minutes (4 hours). Displays current usage vs limit as progress bar.Session Time Limit: Maximum continuous minutes per session. If user stays in app beyond this, doomscroll intervention triggers regardless of other factors. Useful for apps where long sessions problematic even if not scrolling (video streaming, gaming).Quiet Hours: Time ranges when app automatically blocked. Example: block Instagram from 10 PM to 7 AM for sleep protection, block work email on weekends for work-life balance. Set start and end times for each day of week.Allowed Locations: Geofencing integration. App only accessible at specified locations. Example: work apps only at office, social media only at home. Requires location permission.Smart Scheduling: "Block when Calendar shows meetings", "Allow only during lunch hours", "Block during commute times". Requires calendar permission.Break After Use: Mandatory break period after using app. Example: after 20 minutes on Instagram, require 10-minute break before allowing app again. Prevents immediate re-opening spirals.Each app's custom rules card shows summary: "Instagram: 30 min daily limit, blocked 10 PM-7 AM, 5 min break after use".Healthy Alternatives ListConfigure Replacement Activities
When user opens blocked app or gets doomscroll intervention, Breathe suggests healthy alternatives. This section lets users customize that list.Default suggestions: "Take a 5-minute walk", "Drink a glass of water", "Do 10 deep breaths", "Text a friend", "Read a book", "Stretch for 2 minutes", "Listen to music", "Journal for 5 minutes".Users can add custom alternatives specific to their life: "Play guitar", "Call Mom", "Work on side project", "Draw in sketchbook", "Meditate", "Water plants".Each alternative has optional fields: duration estimate (helps Breathe suggest appropriate alternatives based on available time), category tag (physical activity, social connection, creativity, rest), location requirement (home, outdoors, anywhere).Companion randomly selects from this list when showing interventions, weighted by recent success—if user frequently chooses "take a walk", that gets suggested more often.Option to mark alternatives as "tried" directly from intervention screen. Track which alternatives actually used vs ignored. Breathe learns which suggestions resonate and personalizes over time.Focus Sessions SectionDefault Session PreferencesPreferred Session Type
Radio buttons to select default focus mode: Pomodoro (25 min), Deep Work (60 min), Quick Focus (15 min), Custom. This pre-selects when opening focus screen, though user can change per session.Custom Duration
If Custom selected, number picker for default duration. Slider from 5 to 240 minutes with 5-minute increments. Shows duration in both minutes and hours-minutes format.Break Length
For Pomodoro cycles, set break duration. Slider from 1 to 15 minutes. Default 5 minutes. Explanation: "How long should your breaks be between Pomodoro focus sessions?"Auto-Start Breaks
Toggle whether breaks start automatically when session ends or require manual start. Auto-start helps maintain Pomodoro rhythm but some users want flexibility.Session End Behavior
What happens when focus session completes:
Show Celebration: Full-screen animation with companion in proud state, session summary, encouragement message. Most engaging.
Quiet Notification: Simple notification that session complete, unblock apps silently. Minimal disruption.
Ask for Reflection: Show modal prompting brief reflection on session productivity before closing. Best for learning from patterns.
Auto-Block SettingsUse Default Blocked Apps: Toggle whether to auto-populate blocked apps list from defaults set in App Management section. When enabled, starting focus session pre-selects all default blocked apps. When disabled, shows empty list requiring manual selection each time.Block Notifications Too: Toggle whether notifications from blocked apps are also silenced during focus sessions. Recommended enabled for true focus. When disabled, notifications still appear but opening app blocked.Allow Emergency Calls: Toggle ensuring phone calls always come through even during strictest blocking. Default enabled for safety. Can specify contacts as "always allowed" exceptions.Focus AutomationSchedule Focus Sessions
Create recurring focus sessions that start automatically at specified times. Useful for building habits.Add new scheduled session by specifying:

Day(s) of week: Any combination of Monday through Sunday
Start time: Time picker
Duration: From session type dropdown or custom
Apps to block: Use defaults or specify custom set
Auto-start or notification: Session starts automatically vs notification reminder to start
Examples: "Monday-Friday 9:00 AM, 90 min Deep Work, auto-start", "Daily 2:00 PM, 25 min Pomodoro, notify only".List shows all scheduled sessions with toggle to enable/disable temporarily without deleting.Location-Based Focus
Trigger focus sessions based on location arrival/departure:
"Start 2-hour Deep Work when I arrive at office"
"Start 25-min Quick Focus when I enter library"
"Block social media when I'm at gym"
Requires location permission. Set trigger location by dropping pin on map or selecting from frequent locations. Configure geofence radius (small for precise triggering, large for early activation).Calendar Integration
Connect to device calendar and automatically block apps during calendar events. Configuration options:
Block During All Events: Any calendar event triggers app blocking
Block During Specific Events: Only events with certain keywords in title (meeting, focus, work, class)
Block Before Events: Block 5/10/15 minutes before event to ensure punctuality
Allow During Social Events: Skip blocking for events categorized as personal/social
Requires calendar permission. Shows next 5 upcoming events that will trigger blocks for preview.Focus History & InsightsSession History Retention
How long to keep completed focus session records. Options: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, Forever. Affects storage usage and historical insights availability. Default 90 days balances insights with storage.Productivity Scoring
Toggle whether Breathe calculates productivity score for each session. When enabled, score based on completion vs planned duration, interruptions, early terminations. When disabled, just tracks time without judgment. Some users find scoring motivating, others find it stressful.Focus Streaks
Toggle streak tracking. When enabled, companion celebrates consecutive days with completed focus sessions. Shows current streak on home screen. Gamification element that motivates some users but pressures others.Doomscroll Detection SectionThis section controls the sophisticated intervention system that catches users mid-scroll.Detection SensitivityMaster Detection Toggle
Large prominent toggle at top: "Enable Doomscroll Detection". When off, Breathe never shows interventions regardless of scrolling behavior. Only monitors and logs patterns for insights. When on, actively intervenes.Clear explanation: "When enabled, Breathe monitors your scrolling patterns and gently intervenes when you're stuck in an endless scroll loop."Sensitivity Level
Three preset levels with detailed explanation of what each means:Lenient: Triggers intervention after 20+ minutes continuous scrolling, allows more refreshes before intervening, higher tolerance for velocity scrolling, better for users new to Breathe or who want minimal interruption. Stats: Warning at 20 min, strong warning at 35 min, block at 60 min.Balanced (Default): Triggers after 12+ minutes continuous scrolling, moderate refresh tolerance, standard velocity thresholds. Good middle ground for most users. Stats: Warning at 12 min, strong warning at 25 min, block at 45 min.Strict: Triggers after 7+ minutes continuous scrolling, low refresh tolerance, quick intervention on high-velocity scrolling, best for users seriously combating doomscroll addiction. Stats: Warning at 7 min, strong warning at 15 min, block at 30 min.Visual indicator shows where on spectrum current setting falls. Live preview showing "Based on your settings, Breathe would have intervened X times yesterday."Custom Sensitivity (Advanced)
For power users, expose granular controls:

Warning threshold (minutes): Slider 5-30
Strong warning threshold (minutes): Slider 10-60
Block threshold (minutes): Slider 15-120
Scroll velocity threshold (pixels/sec): Slider 200-500
Refresh count threshold: Slider 3-10
Interaction ratio requirement: Slider 0-50%
Real-time preview shows "Based on these settings, this would trigger after scrolling Instagram for X minutes at current pace."Intervention StyleEscalation Pattern
How aggressively Breathe escalates from gentle warning to hard block:Gentle: Only show awareness notifications, never block. User maintains full control. Lowest friction but requires most self-discipline.Progressive (Default): Three-stage escalation—notification warning, then full-screen intervention with breathing exercise, finally temporary block if ignored. Balances support with autonomy.Aggressive: Skip straight to full-screen intervention on first trigger, block on second trigger. Most restrictive but most effective for serious addiction.Intervention ContentBreathing Exercise Required: Toggle whether intervention overlays must complete breathing exercise before dismissing. When enabled, user must watch three breath cycles before actions available. When disabled, actions immediately available. Default enabled—the pause is the point.Reflection Prompts: Toggle whether interventions ask "What are you looking for right now?" before allowing app access. Helps surface underlying needs driving doomscrolling. Default enabled.Show Time Wasted: Toggle whether interventions display "You've spent X minutes scrolling". Can be motivating or demotivating depending on personality. Default enabled.Companion Reactions: Toggle whether companion shows disappointed/concerned expressions during interventions. Emotional feedback is powerful but may feel guilt-inducing for some. Default enabled.Time-Based RulesQuiet Hours for Interventions
Time ranges when interventions never trigger, even if doomscrolling detected. Useful for designated relaxation time.Example: "Don't intervene 7:00-8:00 PM (my wind-down time)" or "Don't intervene Saturday mornings (my lazy time)". Set by day of week and time range.Explanation: "Sometimes scrolling is intentional relaxation. Set when Breathe shouldn't interrupt you."Aggressive Hours
Inverse of quiet hours—times when detection becomes more sensitive. Example: "Be extra vigilant 10 PM - midnight (protect my sleep)" or "Strict during work hours 9 AM - 5 PM".When in aggressive hours, sensitivity automatically increases one level (lenient becomes balanced, balanced becomes strict, strict becomes maximum sensitivity).Late Night Protection
Special toggle for stricter intervention after certain time. Common use case: prevent 2 AM doomscrolling that destroys next day.Enable toggle, set threshold time (default 11 PM), choose behavior: "Show strong warning after 15 min" or "Block all monitored apps" or "Show companion in sleeping state with suggestion to rest".Intervention Response TrackingOverride Limit
How many times user can override interventions in single day before escalating. Number picker 1-10. Default 3. Example: After overriding third intervention, fourth intervention cannot be dismissed for 5 minutes (or uses next escalation level).Prevents users from developing habit of dismissing interventions without considering them.Override Cooldown
After overriding intervention, how long until you can override again. Slider 5-60 minutes. Default 15 minutes. Creates consequence for repeated overrides without being punitive.Block Duration
When intervention escalates to temporary block, how long should block last. Slider 10-120 minutes. Default 30 minutes. After duration expires, app auto-unblocks without requiring user action.Allow Emergency Override
Toggle whether user can force-override any block by long-pressing for 10 seconds. Provides escape hatch for legitimate urgent needs while maintaining friction. Default enabled.When emergency override used, companion shows very disappointed state and notes override in daily patterns. Not judging, just acknowledging.Notifications & Alerts SectionReturn NotificationsWhen Snoozed Items Return
